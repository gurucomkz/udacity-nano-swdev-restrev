This project is my work for "Project 3: Restaurant Reviewer" in [Senior Web Developer Udacity Nanodegree course](https://www.udacity.com/course/senior-web-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd802).

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.15.1.

## Build & development

* `npm install`
* `bower install`

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing With Chromevox Lite

I've included Chromevox Lite wrapper so any can test ARIA functionality with ease.

Navigate to `test.html` to test with Chromevox Lite.
